This source was leaked by Frosted Developers.

Do not even try stealing from this source like you're TSL, it'll make you 50x worst at coding.

## Why is this source leaked?
Well.. TSL has stolen come from others multiple times.

TSL is also known for using AI in his code. He always deny the usage of AI, but the usage is pretty obvious.

TSL does not care about his members. He can not code anything special for you all. And never has.

He only wants to team up with others for information. He is now going back to "saving realms" but we know he still actively attacks realms today. He is not slick at all.

TSL can't do anything without being carried by AI or stealing from other sources. Which is not right in this case.

He does not care how this bot is coded.

## Where most of it was stolen from
Most of this code was stolen from the Yern leak by [shadowwwmain](https://github.com/shadowwwmain). He owned the [Yern-Leak-V2](https://github.com/shadowwwmain/Yern-Leak-V2) repository. The repository was taken down on February 3rd 2025 by himself after me explaining why it was bad for it to be up. The Yern leak source was a fork a Crashary, a previously project I did with another developer. I will not get into the details about how that got leaked here. I will now use Crashary source code leak in the examples below instead of Yern leak in this case. **None of these sources are public today.**

## Examples of stolen code
Any prismarine-auth with options has the `doSisuAuth: true` field. This field is no longer used in prismarine-auth, and was only used in the Crashary source code leak.

Found in each command file in `./commands/nuking`, you will find a genrandomstring function that was stolen from the Crashary source code leak, the only thing changed about it is the function name. Otherwise this is a exact match.

[This file](./functions/handleScrapper.js) is not fully coded by TSL. Some of the code is found from https://github.com/kpxyy/LFG-Realm-Scrapper (one of my side-projects I have decided to publish on GitHub).

He has not asked for consent for any of this code he has stolen. Furthermore, when he has asked, and the other person has said no, he'll still take the code for his own bot.

## Poorly secure bot
This bot does not have good security. Data could've been leaked, instead I have deleted those files. The bot is not secure at all because the files were saved raw. Meaning it was not being saved in a proper database. Your accounts linked to Frosted could've been used or stolen without your consent! Which is not good for you if you had used this bot. I recommend that you go and secure your account as soon as possible.

You should never use your main account while linking to a discord bot like this. Even when I suggest alternatives to you, you should never use your main account.

## What do I do now knowing this?
You stay away from TSL's community, leave it entirely. He is not trustable with your data and any other information. He can't keep up on what he wants to do yet. He has considered both realms and nuking, but always goes towards nuking, and then later saving realms. He can't keep it up. He doesn't listen to anybody. So therefore, this is his punishment for it all.

TSL still considers chat spam his main feature of each bot he has made, which I know more bots that don't do this, or the behaviors he has done to others.

Make sure to keep your account safe and secure when linking to other bots. If you are coming from a part of the community which isn't about bots like this one, then you can safety quit reading here.

Here's a list below of all the bots still out there today. These are way more better than this bot.

MRGA - https://discord.gg/VJxp42NJrZ (nah use the one below)

Elysium - https://discord.gg/RNCbjqME6j

Oppenheimer - https://discord.gg/JMRnkFGVeE

These bots can actually give more room for experience other than TSL's bot.
